# gemcutter

This is now the `gemcutter` gem only, that provides `gem yank` and `gem webhook`. The Rails app has moved to rubygems/rubygems.org, so please update your links/remotes!

## Setup/testing

Run:

```
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

And your tests should run!

## Contributions

Gemcutter has a 'commit-bit' policy, much like the Rubinius project. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you can get full commit access to the project. All you have to do is ask us on #gemcutter on Freenode or bug qrush in a message and he'll add you as a collaborator on the main repository. Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

Please read up on the [GitHub Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/rubygems/gemcutter/contribution-guidelines) for the latest contribution guidelines.

## License

Gemcutter uses the MIT license. Please check the LICENSE file for more details.
